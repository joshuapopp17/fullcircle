# full circle app

## Description

Full circle is a guided journaling app that allows users to quickly fill out a daily journal entry. By adding friends and maintaining a public streak, users are encouraged to continue journaling and stay on track. With a self receiving letter system users can write themselves letters which are delivered one month later. This allows users to learn more about themselves and see their progression in real time. Everything we do today helps us progress, it all comes full circle.
